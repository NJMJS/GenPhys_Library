# GenPhys_Library
A general purpose library for solving simple physics equations.

All variable in the equations are optional. You must leave exactly one variable empty when calling them.

Initiallze the class and call the functions inside of the class to solve.
Call <var>.Help() for an explanation for each available function.
  
Vf = Final Velocity. 
Vs = Start Velocity.
Ek = Kenetic Energy.
Ep = Potential Energy.
Rad = Radian.
Ac = Centripital Acceleration
Et = Total Energy
Ek = Kinetic Energy
Ep = Potential Energy

All other variables represent what they would normally.

TODO: 
  .Work(): Solve for the Radian value when W, F, and D are all values.
